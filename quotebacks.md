Quotebacks are a new "UX standard for quoting online" developed by Tom Critchlow and Toby Shorin. They are designed to "make it easy to reference content and create dialogue with other sites by turning snippets of text into elegant, self-contained blockquote components."

<p><strong>Why quote?</strong></p>
				<p>Our overal design goals are to help <em>maintain context</em> when composing new texts with quotes, to enable <em>generous quotations</em>, and to facilitate quoting <em>all texts and voices</em>. A bit more about these goals:</p>
				<p>
					First and foremost, quoting gives context, helping readers see where an author is coming from. Quotes and citations are an important part in making and remembering history. And looking looking towards the future, they allow us to better see, understand, and build on the vast graph of human knowledge—the original "web"—that other, greater internet of which this one is just part.
				</p>
				<p>
					Secondly, quoting another person can be <em>generous</em>. Generous quoting can mean raising another's voice alongside your own, affirming their authorship, and striving to not take them out of context. One can quote generously, no matter whether one is agreeing or disagreeing with another author.</p>

The Quotebacks extension for Chromium and Firefox-based browsers allows you to highlight text on the web as you visit sites. These quotes are saved to your browser's local storage in a simple JSON format.
